# to-watch-app
A application that randomly choose a movie to watch.

I was bored and seeking a film to watch and decided to create a app to help me in this mission.
I created this repo to make the creation of this repo something public and watchable, like a journey.
Certainly we will use the IMDb API to take some films, and create this app, let's go?
